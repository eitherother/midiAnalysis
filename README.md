Framework for Midi Analysis

The repository contains skeleton C code suitable for statistical andnumerical
studies using midi data. In its current state, the programonly prints out the
contents of its structs, but can be easily modified to perform other computations.
The program includes a copy of MIDICSV (http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/midicsv/)
in the src/ directory to generate a more user-friendly format for processing.
